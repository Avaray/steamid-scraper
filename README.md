# This is Scraper for SteamIDs

I created it spontaneously because I needed a huge amount of valid SteamIDs for my another project.

I will use GitHub actions. Script will run every day and get list of X amount of SteamIDs. Script will upodate the list of SteamIDs in the repository. List will grow every day. The only downside is that I follow friends of friends. This is slower than starting from first possible ID, but in this way I will get real people.

## TODO's

- [ ] Split database into smaller files (e.g. 10k IDs per file)
- [ ] Make code better
